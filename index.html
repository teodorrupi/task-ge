</a>1. Test case design and planning</h3>

<p><strong>Plan:</strong> Verify item departure/arrival correspond with user search / search performed correctly. <br/>
   <strong>Plan:</strong> Verify items have prices <br/>
   <strong>Plan:</strong> Verify click-out/booking button works and reaches the corresponding partner  <br/>
   <strong>Plan:</strong> Verify that summary module works as expected (showing the corresponding cheapest/fastest/etc. from the results)   <br/>
   <strong>Plan:</strong> Verify item sorting by price (default sort ?) and sorting (smart/fast/price/depart time/checkin time) is done correctly<br/>
   <strong>Plan:</strong> Verify results with data from the database <br/>
   <strong>Plan:</strong> On session expire, after doing a reload of page, check if destinations are preserved and prices are available <br/>
   <strong>Plan:</strong> Verify results with data from the database  </p>

</a>2. Test automation</h3>

<p>Please find in the repo (master branch) the selenium project, production ready. Highly scalable structure, detailed reporting via
Serenity and easily to integrate with JenkinsCI/ <a href="http://tech.trivago.com/2015/12/02/selenium_with_kibana/"> Kibana Reporting </a> or Monte-CC library for
video recording of the tests.</p>

</a>3. SQL</h3>

<p><strong>a)</strong> From Employee ( id, name, department_fk ) (10 records) , Department ( id, name) (5 records) tables, selecting everything would return 50 results. Since we neglect to define the correlation between tables
using a WHERE clause, this acts as in a CROSS JOIN between tables, giving the value of one column/-set associated with every other possible result selected. In this case SELECT * FROM 'Employee', 'Department' is equivalent to
  SELECT * FROM 'Employee' CROSS JOIN 'Department'</p>
<p><strong>b)</strong> In order to select the first 5 records from a table, we can use <code>limit</code> on the results. <br> SELECT * from table_name limit 5 </p>
<p><strong>c)</strong> The Having clause its mostly useful with aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, and is used with the Group By clause. The Group By clause is used to create groups of result-sets.
  <br> For example, table <code>Spending</code> with column:data <br> Name: 'A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'B' and Spent: 10, 20, 15, 10, 10 is created. <br>
  <code>SELECT Name, sum(Spent) from Spending group by Name; </code> <br>This will allow us to treat each name as a group and have all non repeating names with their sums aggregated.
  <br> <code>SELECT Name, sum(Spent) from Spending group by Name having sum(Spent) > 15;</code> <br> This will allow us that from all the groups aggreated with their sum, to only
show the ones which are Having CONDITION (here smaller than 15). In this case we exclude C from the result set.</p>
